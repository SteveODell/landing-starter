# landing-starter
I am always validating ideas, so Ive decided to create a simple landing page starter. 

You can simply clone it, start changing the content and use it immediately. 

It is built in AngularJS (using Angular Material), Node and Express. 
You can choose to use Mailgun.js to collect sign-up data as well.
